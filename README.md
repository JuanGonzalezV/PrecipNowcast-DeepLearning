## üìÑ Abstract  
Extreme precipitation events, defined as periods where empirical rainfall thresholds are abruptly exceeded, are of significant interest to urban planners, water researchers, and climate-related institutions. This thesis proposes a data-driven approach to analyze, nowcast, and classify extreme precipitation events using hydroclimate features from two climatological stations.  

The methodology involves:  
1. **Pre-processing**: Cleaning and preparing precipitation-related time series data.  
2. **Feature Selection**: Applying correlation analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Regressional Relief-F (RR) for exploratory analysis.  
3. **Classification**: Using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.  
4. **Regression**: Designing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and 1-D/2-D convolutions to learn spatio-temporal representations of weather variables.  

Results show that non-standardized RR outperforms PCA in feature discrimination, while the CNN-based regression model demonstrates promising nowcasting capabilities for extreme precipitation events.
